I am a postdoctoral associate at MIT. I completed my Ph.D. at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) working on the topic of dynamic modelling of wind farms for closed-loop control applications. My work revolves around dynamic wind farm simulations, wake modelling, closed-loop control, and machine learning.
