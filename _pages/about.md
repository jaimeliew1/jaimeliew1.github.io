I am a wind energy researcher and engineer. I completed my Ph.D. at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) working on the topic of dynamic modelling of wind farms for closed-loop control applications. This was followed by a postdoc at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). My work revolves around dynamic wind farm simulations, wake modelling, closed-loop control, and machine learning.
